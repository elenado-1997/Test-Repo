You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls

If the world turned dark and fell apart
You still have the love light in your heart
I hope you know it
I hope you know it

If the kids in charge tryna burn our forest
I'd be outside Congress throwing rocks
I hope you know it
I hope you know it

You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls, yeah

You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls

That's why the sun will rise above
And hit our doors and we'll march out
We're moving forwards
Into brighter futures where we're moving towards
Let me hear your voice
'Cause when the stars align
We as the youth have to see the sign
Fill up the streets with our love and pride
The hatred will never survive
I hope you know

You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls, yeah

You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls, yeah
